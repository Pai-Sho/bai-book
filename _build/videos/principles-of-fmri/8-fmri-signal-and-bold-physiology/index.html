<p>Q. Does the peak at 5 second indicate the time of the highest neural activity? If so, how? If not, why not?</p>
<p>A. No, the peak indicates the period of highest blood flow, which happens 4-6 seconds after the peak neural activity as the body overcompensates for the metabolic demands of the neural activity.</p>
<p>Q. Suppose we choose a TR of 500ms. Roughly at which frame (e.g., 5th, 10th, 15th ...etc) may we observe the peak response?</p>
<p>A. This would occur at roughly the 10th frame, or 5 seconds.</p>

<p>This graph is used to illustrate multiple issues related to nonlinearity. See if you can identify specific patterns or features in the graph that illustrate the said issues.</p>
<p>Q. Where in the graph can we see that there is non-linearity if two stimuli are closer than 5 seconds apart?</p>
<p>A. With the red lines representing a train of 1 or 2 checkerboards. The response to 2 events should be twice as high as one, but it is nowhere near that level of response.</p>
<p>Q. Where in the graph can we there is non-linearity if two stimuli are more than 5 seconds apart?</p>
<p>A. With the green lines. The response should be 3 times higher than with 1, but it is only about half of the predicted value.</p>
<p>Q. Where in the graph can we see the effect of saturation?</p>
<p>A. The blue lines, representing the trains of 10 or 11 events. The peak is no higher than the 5 or 6 example, which means the neural response has been saturated.</p>
