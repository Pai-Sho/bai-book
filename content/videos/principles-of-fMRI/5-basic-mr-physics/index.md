# Questions

## Longitudinal Relaxation

![longitudinal-relaxation-time](longitudinal-relaxation-time.png)

Q. If a tissue type is said to have a faster longitudinal relaxation time, does it imply that its T1 value is higher or lower?

A. Lower. A lower T1 implies a shorter amount of time needed for the net magnetization to reach 63% of its original state.

## Transverse Relaxation

Q. If a tissue type is said to have a faster transverse decay, does it imply that its T2 value is higher or lower?

A. Lower. A lower T2 implies less time needed for the net magnetization to decay to 37% due to loss of phase coherence.


## Longitudinal Magnetization and Tissue Types

Q. If a new tissue type is said to have a faster longitudinal magnetization relaxation time than that of all the three tissue types shown, where do you expect to see the line of that new tissue type lies (i.e., above or below)?

A. Above, because it will reach 63% net magnetization before the rest of them.

Q. Suppose TR is set to 1000. Consider two brain areas A and B. A is composed of 80% white matter and 20% CSF. B is composed of 80% gray matter and 20% CSF. Which brain area may look brighter in an image that emphasizes T1 characteristics (i.e., T1 weighted image)? Why?

A. A will appear brighter, because the white matter will have produced a stronger signal by 1000ms than the gray matter.


Q. Now suppose we increase TR from 1000 to 3000. Does the difference in brightness between A and B increase or decrease? Why?

A. The difference will decrease, because by 3000ms both the Gray and White matter signals have returned almost to 100% of their original net magnetization. It will be difficult to distinguish between the two.
